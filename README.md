To generate a strong password, follow the steps below:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the website where you must create a password.

2. Look for a prompt that initiates the password generation process. Click on it.

3. You'll be asked to choose the length of your password. Enter a number between 8 and 128 when prompted. If you enter a number outside of this range, the process will end.

4. Next, choose the type of characters you want to include in your password. You can choose from uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Select at least one of these options.

5. Once you've selected, the password generator will create a strong, unique password for you.

Remember to save your password securely and not to share it with anyone.
* Uppercase Characters
* Lowercase Characters
* Numerals
* Special Characters

The generation process is terminated if at least one of these items is not chosen. When all criteria are met, a generated password should appear in the "`Your Secure Password`" field.
